" This is a  simple script to quicky insert a print statement in your code.
" Currently supported languages are : 
"       C
"       Scheme, Lisp , OCaml/Omlet, Haskell
"       Java
" It also indents current line and puts the cursor where you expect it to be, in
" insert mode of course !

For example, in C, it would insert a printf("X"); while in Scheme, you'd have a (display X), where X is the cursor position.

Mapped to <Leader>P in normal mode
abbreviated to pap in insert mode (as in "PrintAPrint")

TODO :
More languages to be added as I'm requested.
Some more idiomatic statements may replace those I chose, and the possibility to choose between several printers ? (print, display, pretty-print, show....)
